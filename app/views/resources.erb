  <h1 id="mission">Our Mission</p>
  
  <h3 id=mission>eat.safe Chicago set out to solve a simple problem: how can food-allergic and food-intolerant diners quickly and easily find restaurants that will properly accommodate their individual dietary needs? Our goal is to give people with food allergies opportunities to enjoy a delicious meal out without having to worry about having an allergic reaction and feeling restricted to certain options.</h3>

  <h1 id="about">About the Creators</h1>
  
 
  <p id=about>This app was created by Meredith, Ananya, and Rowa through Kode with Klossy 2018 Chicago camp. They are all high schoolers from the Chicagoland area. Meredith has a severe peanut allergy, so combined with their passions for food, they teamed up to create a website that lets people with all kinds of allergies enjoy the great food Chicago has to offer.</p>
